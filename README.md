## Description

While looking for cool activities to do in Portland this summer, we noticed that there were quite a few free movies playing at parks around the city. However, being new to the area, it was tough for us to know exactly which movies were close just based off addresses. We decided to work on a way to showcase where a movie's location was on a google map for easy viewing. This app shows the first ten movie location from the link below along with movie and location details on a google map. It will optionally get your geolocation and then center the map over that location, so you can see what's nearby.
